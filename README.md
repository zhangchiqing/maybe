### A tutorial about Maybe pattern and how to use it to prevent TypeError

The purpose of this repo is to introduce a very useful pattern called "Maybe" from functional programming, which can be used to avoid one of the most common Type Error in JavaScript, "can not find property of undefined"

The reason I call it Maybe Pattern instead of Maybe library is because the pattern can be implemented in different ways with different data structures. This repo implemented in a very simple way that has no dependency on any other library so that it's easier for reader to understand how exactly it works.

I split the whole tutorial into several lessons to introduce separately the pain point, how it works, the benefits and the alternative implementations.

If you are interested so far. Let's get started. Lesson 1: the Pain points
